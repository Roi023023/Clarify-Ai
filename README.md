# 🧠 Clarify-AI

A final project in Deep Learning specialization.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop a system capable of exposing **deception in articles** by analyzing **linguistic and logical patterns**.

Existing solutions focus on fact-checking. Our system addresses the critical gap by identifying **style-based manipulation** (rhetoric, argumentative structure) that creates a misleading impression, independent of factual verification.

## 📝 Project Description

The system is based on a **Deep Learning model** designed to classify various types of linguistic manipulations within a text using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

We leverage existing English datasets, which will be translated into Hebrew, and utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for tagging and classification of Hebrew texts.

### Key Deception Categories Identified:

The model targets patterns such as:

* Logical Jumps.
* Emotional/Dramatic Language.
* Vague Source.
* Attribution of Intent.
* Overgeneralization.
* Intentional Ambiguity.
* Biased Framing.
