🧠 Linguistic Deception Detection System
A final project in Deep Learning specialization.
🎯 Project Goal
To develop a system capable of exposing deception in articles by analyzing linguistic and logical patterns.
Existing solutions focus on fact-checking against external sources. Our system addresses the critical gap by identifying style-based manipulation (rhetoric, argumentative structure) that creates a misleading impression, independent of factual verification.
📝 Project Description
The system is based on a Deep Learning model designed to classify various types of linguistic manipulations within a text using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It does not rely on external fact-checking3.We leverage existing English datasets, which will be translated into Hebrew, and utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for tagging and classification of Hebrew texts.
Key Deception Categories Identified:The model targets patterns such as:
Logical Jumps.
Emotional/Dramatic Language.
Vague Source ("Sources close to...").
Attribution of Intent.
Overgeneralization.
Intentional Ambiguity.
Biased Framing
